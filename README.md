# World Events Effect on Gold, Oil and the S&P 500 Index


## Proposal
The aim of this project is to undertake a quantitative analysis of Gold, Oil and the S&P 500 Index trends from previous years and determine how they are affected by world events.

Specifically, we will be looking at the following:
* 911
* GCF
* COVID-19
* Ukraine Russia War

Using the knowledge obtained in Monash Fintech Bootcamp the group, Andrew, Alex, Vinay, Abdul and Jack, will read, clean, and analyse Gold, Oil and the S&P 500 Index data during these periods.

### Questions
* What are the trends of Gold, Oil and the S&P 500 Index in relation to man-made disasters? (GFC, 911)
* What are the trends of Gold, Oil and the S&P 500 Index in relation to natural disasters? (GFC, 911)
* What are the potential long-term effects of war from the analysis of previous war data? (Afganistan, Iraq Wars)
* What are the current short-term effects of war? (Ukraine Russia War)

### Sources of Data

For this analysis our group sourced data from the yFinance python library.
yFinance is an open-source tool that uses Yahoo Finance's publicly avaliable API to provide financial data.
